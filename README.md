# Crime Rate Prediction Model for Los Angeles

The project aims to develop a predictive model for crime rates in Los Angeles to enhance public safety measures and resource allocation. Given the dynamic nature of crime patterns, precise forecasting can help law enforcement agencies to preemptively address potential hotspots.

## Objective

The primary objective is to accurately forecast crime occurrences across Los Angeles using historical crime data.

## Data Source

- [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)

## Data Preparation

### Preprocessing Steps

- Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.
- Date and time entries were standardized, and geographical data were verified for accuracy.
- Features like day of the week, month, and hour of the day were engineered from date-time information.
